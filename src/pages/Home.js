        A sliver is a small part of a whole, and also one of my favorite types of creatures in Magic: the Gathering, an extremely nerdy game...  But those creatures are fragments of their whole, and as multiple of them come together they share and become one, I guess that is where the name comes from, LOL. <br />
        But that is how I look at all of the different aspects of myself, they are all just slivers that make up the whole that is me.  And I have many different slivers, all with different things to share. <br />
