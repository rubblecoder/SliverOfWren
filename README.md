This is the codebase for a personal website to also be used as a portfolio to demonstrate skills and show off current projects.

## Tools/Libraries Used

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Still a work in progress.  More to come shortly.

Currently it is just the skeleton of the site. Working on adding a chatroom that will use Google Translation API to translate the conversation.

## Chatroom Demo

The chatroom demo is still a work in progress but coming along.  Currently working on getting socket.io server and client working.  The server is located in SilverOfWrenBackend repo(https://github.com/rubblecoder/SliverOfWrenBackend).
